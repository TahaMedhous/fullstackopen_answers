    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa
    activate server

    server-->>browser: Response with HTML page, spa.js, css

    deactivate server

    browser->>server: sending GET request to https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
      Note right of browser: after receiving the HTML page, the browser runs the JavaScript code (inside spa.js) that requests JSON data from the server


    server-->>browser: Response with JSON data
    deactivate server

      Note right of browser: using DOM manipulation, the browser runs the function that renders the notes to the display by looping through the JSON data, creating HTML elements and adding them to the DOM
